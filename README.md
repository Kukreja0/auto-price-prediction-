# Automobile Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project Report

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the price of automobiles based on their specifications such as engine size, horsepower, curb weight, fuel type, body style, and more.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Risk analysis  
- Final conclusions

---

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts automobile prices using available features.  
This helps manufacturers, dealers, and customers understand price determinants and estimate fair pricing.

---

## 3. Dataset Description
Typical features included:
- **Numerical Features:** price, engine-size, horsepower, curb-weight, wheel-base, length, width, bore, stroke  
- **Categorical Features:** make, body-style, drive-wheels, fuel-type, aspiration, fuel-system  
- **Target Variable:** price

---

## 4. Data Preprocessing
###  Handling Missing Values
- Numerical features → filled using mean/median  
- Categorical features → filled using mode  

###  Encoding  
- **Label Encoding** for ordinal-like categories  
- **One-Hot Encoding** for nominal categories  

###  Outlier Removal  
Used IQR (Interquartile Range) method to remove extreme outliers from numerical columns.

###  Train–Test Split  
Data split into **80% training** and **20% testing**.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  Univariate Analysis
- Histograms  
- Boxplots  
- Distribution plots  

###  Bivariate Analysis
- Scatter plots (price vs horsepower, price vs engine-size)  
- Heatmap correlations  

###  Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation matrix  
- Pair plots  

###  Key Insights
- Engine size and horsepower have strong positive correlation with price.  
- Curb weight also strongly affects vehicle pricing.  

---

## 6. Feature Selection
Used:
- Correlation matrix  
- Domain knowledge  
- Variance threshold  
- Multicollinearity check (VIF)

Selected major features:
- engine-size  
- curb-weight  
- horsepower  
- width  
- wheel-base  

---

## 7. Model Selection
Models considered:
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Ridge/Lasso Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
- **XGBoost Regressor**

Best model selected based on:
- R² score  
- MAE  
- RMSE  

---

## 8. Model Training & Evaluation
Example evaluation metrics:
- **R² Score:** 0.85–0.92 (varies by model)  
- **MAE:** Low error range  
- **RMSE:** Indicates good model performance  

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed better than Linear Regression due to non-linear relationships.

---

## 9. Results & Interpretation
- Price prediction accuracy is high for vehicles with typical features.  
- Model performance decreases for rare vehicle types (e.g., sports cars with extreme specs).  

Main factors influencing price:
1. Engine Size  
2. Horsepower  
3. Curb Weight  
4. Width  
5. Number of cylinders

## 10. **Project Risks & Mitigation**

###  1. Data Quality Risk
**Risk:** Missing values, inconsistent labels, incorrect units.  
**Mitigation:** Perform strict validation, cleaning, and schema checks.

###  2. Overfitting Risk
**Risk:** Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.  
**Mitigation:** Use cross-validation, regularization, pruning, and tuning.

###  3. Underfitting Risk
**Risk:** Model is too simple to learn patterns.  
**Mitigation:** Choose non-linear models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

###  4. Feature Engineering Risk
**Risk:** Wrong encoding or removal of important features.  
**Mitigation:** Use correlation analysis + domain expertise.

###  5. Model Bias Risk
**Risk:** Categorical imbalance may bias predictions.  
**Mitigation:** Apply balanced sampling or weighted models.

###  6. Deployment Risk
**Risk:** Model may perform poorly in production due to unseen car models.  
**Mitigation:** Monitor model drift and update regularly.

###  7. Model Drift Risk
**Risk:** Market trends change, affecting price patterns.  
**Mitigation:** Retrain model every 3–6 months.

###  8. Outdated Data Dependency
**Risk:** Model predictions become less useful over time.  
**Mitigation:** Keep dataset updated with new vehicles.
